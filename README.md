## Hi there 👋

- My name is Lasha Porchkhidze. I specialize in D3.js for creating unique data visualizations.
- Programming languages and libraries are never an issue—I love learning and continually improving.

<br/>

- 🔭 I’m currently working on private repositories, which is why you won’t see many contributions on GitHub.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Three.js.
- 📫 How to reach me: lashapor@gmail.com
- 🌐 Some of my public projects: [Lashapor.com ](https://lashapor.com/)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can’t share my real project experience publicly because of private contracts. 😄
